            <h2>Introduction to Raft</h2>
            <p>The Raft consensus algorithm is designed to be easy to understand while providing a practical solution for managing a replicated log. It was introduced by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout in 2014.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leader Election:</strong> Raft uses a leader-based approach where one node is elected as the leader to manage log replication.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Replication:</strong> The leader receives client requests and appends them to its log, then replicates these entries to follower nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Safety:</strong> Raft ensures that committed entries are durable and consistent across all nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Membership Changes:</strong> Raft supports dynamic membership changes, allowing nodes to join or leave the cluster safely.</li>
            </ul>
